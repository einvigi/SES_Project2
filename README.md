# CarParkManagementSystem
In this project me and my collegue Elisa Composta realized an automated car park managemenet system using MSP432 and its boosterpack (Texas Instruments) , to control the number of cars entering a car park to reduce useless traffic and to avoid people wasting their time searching for a (non-existing) park.
